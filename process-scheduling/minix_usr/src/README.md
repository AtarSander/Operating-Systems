# Test description
To start the test go into `mm` directory (memory management server) in `MINIX`. Then run for example `run_test.1.sh`.
## Implemented tests
- `run_test.1.sh` - tests priority of the queues in scheduling algorithm
- `run_test.2.sh` - tests scheduling algorithm with different type of tasks
- `run_test.3.sh` - tests FCFS queue used for computation heavy tasks
- `run_test.4.sh` - tests RR queue for interactive tasks
- `run_test.5.sh` - tests upgrading priority
